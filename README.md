# The GPT-Explainer Project

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application that uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to analyze and generate explanations for PowerPoint presentations.
The application parses a PowerPoint presentation and generates explanations for each slide using the GPT model. The results are outputted to a JSON file.

## Features
1. PowerPoint Parsing: This application can parse any PowerPoint presentation, extracting the text from each slide for analysis.
2. GPT-3.5 Explanations: The text content from each slide is sent to OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. This advanced AI model generates explanations for the contents of the slide.
3. Logging: The application logs its activity, making it easier to debug issues or track its progress. The logging level can be adjusted according to your needs (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).
4. JSON Output: The explanations generated by GPT-3.5 are stored in a JSON file. This format makes it easy to further process the explanations, or simply read them.
5. Rate Limit Handling: The application uses the backoff library to handle rate limits from the OpenAI API. It will retry the API request in case of a rate limit error, ensuring all slides are processed.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- OpenAI API key


## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
    ```shell
   `git clone https://github.com/Scaleup-Excellenteam/final-exercise-damianti/tree/develop`
   
2. Set up the packages:
    ```shell
    -pip install openai
    -pip install python-dotenv
    -pip install backoff
    -pip install pptx
    -pip install asyncio    


3. create .env file and put your own apikey

---------------------
## Usage

1. Run the program:
    ```shell
   python controller/main.py "path/to/presentation.pptx" --log DEBUG --output my_output --dir "path/to/output/dir"

In this command:
- `path/to/presentation.pptx` is the path to the PowerPoint presentation you want to explain.
- `DEBUG` is the logging level (you can also use `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`).
- `my_output` is the name of the output file (without extension).
- `path/to/output/dir` is the directory where you want to save the output file. If not provided, the output will be saved to the current directory.
